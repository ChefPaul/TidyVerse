# TidyVerse Project

There are two parts of this project. First, I chose dplyr and ggplot packages to create programming samples to demonstrate how to use its capabilities from reshape the data to plot analysis results. The dataset that I will be using is Ramen Rating. This dataset is getting from Kaggle.com.

The second part is to extend existing examples from my classmate’s examples with additional annotated code.

## Getting Started

To get started, you will need to install dplyr and ggplot2 packages to run my examples. There are two ways to install these packages in RStudio. One way to install these packages is entering below codes in the console and run. The other way is you can go to the lower-right panel of RStudio, select the Packages tab and click on Install button. You type the name of the packages to be installed in the “Packages(separate multiple packages with a space or comma):” box and press Install.
 
installed.packages('dplyr')
installed.packages('ggplot2')

### What is dplyr?

- It is the next iteration of plyr package.
- It is faster and has a more consistent of API.
- It provides a set of tools that help you solve the most common data manipulation challenges.

### What is ggplot2?

- ggplot2 was based on the Grammar of Graphics.
- It puts an organized framework around the various parts of a graph.
- The components of ggplot grammar are data, aesthetic mapping, geom, stat, scales, theme, and so on. 
- It can be used to create scatter plots, boxplots, histograms, lines best approximating data, etc.
- It is robust and has served statisticians well.

### Functions in the dplyr and ggplot2 packages

Below functions will be used to create programming samples.

- select()
- rename()
- filter()
- everything()
- arrange()
- group_by()
- mutate()
- transmute()
- summarise()
- %>%
- ggplot()

### Extend my examples.

Everyone is welcome to extend my examples. I'm looking forward to seeing my works being extended by any of you. If anyone has any questions, you can reach out to me in Slack. My profile name in Slack is SIE SIONG WONG. Or you can send me an email to SIESIONG.WONG58@spsmail.cuny.edu. I will response to your questions as soon as I see them. Thank You.
